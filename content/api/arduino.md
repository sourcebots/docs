The [Arduino](https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-uno-rev3) provides a
total of 18 pins for either digital input or output (labelled 2 to 13
and A0 to A5), including 6 for analogue input (labelled A0 to A5).

## Accessing the Arduino

The Arduino can be accessed using the `arduino` property of the `Robot`
object.

``` python
my_arduino = r.arduino
```

You can use the GPIO *(General Purpose Input/Output)* pins for anything,
from microswitches to LEDs. GPIO is only available on pins 2 to 13 and
A0 to A5 because pins 0 and 1 are reserved for communication with the
rest of our kit.

## Pin mode

GPIO pins have four different modes. A pin can only have one mode at a
time, and some pins aren't compatible with certain modes. These pin
modes are represented by an
[enum](https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html) which needs to be
imported before they can be used.

``` python
from sbot import GPIOPinMode
```

The input modes closely resemble those of an Arduino. More information
on them can be found in [their
docs](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/DigitalPins).

### Setting the pin mode

You will need to ensure that the pin is in the correct pin mode before
performing an action with that pin. You can read about the possible pin
modes below.

``` python
r.arduino.pins[3].mode = GPIOPinMode.DIGITAL_INPUT_PULLUP
```

### `GPIOPinMode.DIGITAL_INPUT`

In this mode, the digital state of the pin (whether it is high or low)
can be read.

``` python
r.arduino.pins[4].mode = GPIOPinMode.DIGITAL_INPUT

pin_value = r.arduino.pins[4].digital_state
```

### `GPIOPinMode.DIGITAL_INPUT_PULLUP`

Same as `GPIOPinMode.DIGITAL_INPUT`, but with an internal [pull-up
resistor](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pull-up-resistors)
enabled.

``` python
r.arduino.pins[4].mode = GPIOPinMode.DIGITAL_INPUT_PULLUP

pin_value = r.arduino.pins[4].digital_state
```

### `GPIOPinMode.DIGITAL_OUTPUT`

In this mode, we can set binary values of `0V` or `5V` to the pin.

``` python
r.arduino.pins[4].mode = GPIOPinMode.DIGITAL_OUTPUT
r.arduino.pins[6].mode = GPIOPinMode.DIGITAL_OUTPUT

r.arduino.pins[4].digital_state = True
r.arduino.pins[6].digital_state = False
```

### `GPIOPinMode.ANALOGUE_INPUT`

Certain sensors output analogue signals rather than digital ones, and so
have to be read differently. The arduino has six analogue inputs, which
are labelled `A0` to `A5`; however pins `A4` and `A5` are reserved and
cannot be used.

{{% notice tip %}}
Analogue signals can have any voltage, while digital signals can only
take on one of two voltages. You can read more about digital vs analogue
signals [here](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/analog-vs-digital).

``` python
from sbot import AnaloguePin

r.arduino.pins[AnaloguePin.A0].mode = GPIOPinMode.ANALOGUE_INPUT

pin_value = r.arduino.pins[AnaloguePin.A0].analogue_value
```

{{% notice tip %}}
The values are the voltages read on the pins, between 0 and 5.

Pins `A4` and `A5` are reserved and cannot be used.

## Ultrasound Sensors

You can also measure distance using an ultrasound sensor from the
arduino.

``` python
# Trigger pin: 4
# Echo pin: 5
u = r.arduino.ultrasound_sensors[4, 5]

time_taken = u.pulse()

distance_metres = u.distance()
```

{{% notice warning %}}
If the ultrasound signal never returns, the sensor will timeout and
return `None`.
