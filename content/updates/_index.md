Keeping your kit up to date is very important. It enables us to deploy new features, as well as fix bugs. The following table outlines the updates which have been published.

Once you have downloaded the file you need, refer to the documentation on
[updating your pi](/kit/pi/#updating-your-pi) to apply the update.

Each file contains the changes of those before it. If you need to jump up multiple versions, you can do so by using the latest file.
