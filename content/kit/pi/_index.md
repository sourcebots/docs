The Raspberry Pi is enclosed in a plastic case to protect the delicate components, and allow for easier mounting to your robot. It is powered using a micro-USB cable from one of the power board's 5V outputs.

## Included software
The software included on the Raspberry Pi allows it to run your robot. No graphical or user-required software is installed. You _do not_ need to connect to your Raspberry Pi from a computer in order to use your robot.
