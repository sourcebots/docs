Servo Board
===========

The Servo Board can be used to control up to 12 RC servos. Many devices
are available that can be controlled as servos, such as RC motor speed
controllers, and these can also be used with the board.

Indicators
----------

===== ==================== ======================
LED   Meaning              Initial power-up state
===== ==================== ======================
Power The board is powered On
===== ==================== ======================


Connectors
----------

There are 8 servo connections on the left-side of the board, and 4 on
the right. Servo cables are connected vertically, with 0V (the black or
brown wire) at the bottom of the board.

For the servo board to operate correctly, you must connect it to the 12V
power rail from the power board. A green LED will light next to the
servo board 12V connector when it is correctly powered.

Case Dimensions
---------------

The case measures 68x68x21mm. Don't forget that the cables will stick
out.

Specification

You can access the schematics and source code of the firmware on the
servo board in the following places. You do not need this information to
use the board but it may be of interest to some people.
