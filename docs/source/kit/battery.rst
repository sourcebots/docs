   LiPo Battery

Your robot uses lithium-ion polymer (LiPo) batteries.
These are similar to those used in laptops, and are small and light for
the amount of energy they contain. This is great for your robot but it
is vital to treat such a high concentration of energy with respect. If
you do not, there is a serious risk of fire and injury. To avoid this,
you should follow the safety information on this page closely, at all
times.

.. Warning:: You must not use any batteries, chargers, bags or cables not explicitly authorised by SourceBots.

Warnings
--------

-  Never leave batteries unattended when they are in use or charging.
-  Always place the batteries in the provided charging bag when charging
   or storing.
-  Always follow the charging checklist precisely to make sure the
   charger is correctly configured.
-  Always leave the charging leads connected to the battery charger at
   all times.
-  Do not charge or use a damaged battery.
-  If a battery has any cuts, nicks, exposed copper on wires or is
   bulging to the point of no longer being squishy, contact us
   immediately.

.. Danger:: Disobeying the above warnings greatly increases the risk of damage to your battery, which can have **fatal consequences**. If you have any questions or doubts, talk to a member of staff immediately.

Storing batteries
-----------------

When your batteries are not actively in use, they should be safely
stored. You must disconnect the batteries from all electrical equipment,
and place them in the battery charging bag. You should then store the
charging bag in a safe location.

Operating batteries
-------------------

To use your batteries, you must connect them to the power board. Do not
tamper with the cable or connect the batteries to anything other than
the power board (or the charger when charging).

During operation, the battery is protected by over-current protection
and a fuse in the power board. If any equipment is short circuited, the
over-current protection will activate, protecting the battery. In
extreme circumstances the fuse may blow to prevent damage to the
battery. This is an important safety feature: do not, under any
circumstances, bypass the fuse. It is not user serviceable and if it has
blown then the power board must be replaced. If you suspect the fuse has
blown then please contact us straight away.

Mechanical damage to a battery can be dangerous, and a puncture or large
force applied to a battery causes a serious risk of fire. To avoid this,
your battery should be shielded from mechanical damage while you operate
it. Secure your battery to your robot, so that it does not move or fall
off while the robot moves. You should also build a compartment for the
battery to be placed in, so that accidental collisions do not damage the
battery.

Flat batteries
--------------

When the battery has been almost completely discharged, the Power Board
will automatically turn off and the LED marked “Power / Flat Battery
Indicator” in the `diagram </kit/power-board>`__ will
flash red and green. You should immediately disconnect the battery.
