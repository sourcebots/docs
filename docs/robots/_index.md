In this year's competition we have 2 Robots, which are each controlled by their own python file.

- [Crane Robot](crane) which is controlled by `crane.py`.
- [Forklift Robot](forklift) which is controlled by `forklift.py`.

There is also a [Physical Robot](physical).

See [the API section](/api/) for more details on how to run your code.
