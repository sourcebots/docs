title: Servos
---

By itself, an Arduino is incapable of driving servos, without a lot of hard work and pin munging. So we're using a shield instead! This shield allows control of sixteen servos.

## Connecting your servos
There are a total of sixteen servo connectors, grouped into four groups of four. Servo cables are connected with 0V (the black or brown wire) towards the side of the reset button.

## Power
The Arduino itself is powered entirely over USB. If you wish to use servos, you'll need to supply an additional 5V through the connector on the shield from the [power board](/kit/power-board). There are two red LEDs next to the power input that will turn on if the board is correctly powered.
