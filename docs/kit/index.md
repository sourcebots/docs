## Boards

Your kit consists of 5 main "boards":

| [Motor Board](./motor-board.md) | [Power Board](./power-board.md) | [Servo Board](./servo-board.md) | [Arduino](./arduino.md) | [Raspberry Pi](./pi.md) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ![Motor Board](../assets/img/kit/mcv4b.png) | ![Power Board](../assets/img/kit/pbv4.png) | ![Servo Board](../assets/img/kit/sbv4.png) | ![Arduino](../assets/img/kit/arduino_headers.png) | ![Pi](../assets/img/kit/pi.jpg) |

It should be noted that only the Raspberry Pi and Power Board are required for your kit to work. The other boards will provide useful features to help your robot work.

You will also need a [Battery](./batteries.md) to use your kit, although this may not be supplied to you immediately.
