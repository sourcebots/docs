title: Game State

## Mode

Your robot will behave slightly differently between testing and in the
arena.

The main difference is that your robot will stop when the match is over,
but you may also want to make your own changes to your robot's
behaviour.

Your robot can be in 1 of 2 modes: `DEVELOPMENT` and `COMPETITION`. By
default, your robot will be in `DEVELOPMENT` mode:

``` python
robot.is_competition
>> False
```

During competition mode, your robot will stop executing code at the end
of the match.

## Zone

Your robot will start in a corner of the arena, known as its starting
zone. The number of zones depends on the game. Each zone is given a
number, which you can access with the `zone` property:

``` python
robot.zone
>> 1
```

During a competition match, a USB drive will be used to tell your robot
which corner it's in. By default during development, this is `0`.
